            Essentially, these requests are nothing more than a short message to someone with a description of changes made to a branch. By sending a pull request or merge request, youâ€™re asking the receiver of the request to review those changes prior to merging them into another branch.

            Thereâ€™s often confusion between terms pull request vs. merge request. That confusion lies in the fact that a pull request and a merge request are actually one and the sameâ€”but they differ depending on which sites theyâ€™re used.

            There are three major benefits of using a pull request:

            <br></br>    <br></br>
            Communication between developers - The first is that you can easily summarize software features and fixes into identifiable containers, aka service providers like GitHub or Bitbucket. It also enables development teams to leave comments and view changes in one place.
            <br></br>    <br></br>
            Accessibility to merge tools
            <br></br>   <br></br>
            Clear history of changes - A major highlight of using a pull request is that the team will be able to see any changes between the main branch and the feature branch. Additionally, any discussions are recorded and stored in chronological order.
