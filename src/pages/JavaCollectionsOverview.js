            Any group of individual objects which are represented as a single unit is known as the collection of the objects. In Java, a separate framework named the ‚ÄúCollection Framework‚Äù has been defined in JDK 1.2 which holds all the collection classes and interface in it.

           <b>A framework is a set of classes and interfaces which provide a ready-made architecture. In order to implement a new feature or a class, there is no need to define a framework. However, an optimal object-oriented design always includes a framework with a collection of classes such that all the classes perform the same kind of task. </b>

            Consistent API: The API has a basic set of interfaces like Collection, Set, List, or Map, all the classes (ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, etc) that implement these interfaces have some common set of methods.

            <br></br> <br></br>
            Reduces programming effort: A programmer doesn‚Äôt have to worry about the design of the Collection but rather he can focus on its best use in his program. Therefore, the basic concept of Object-oriented programming (i.e.) abstraction has been successfully implemented.
 
            <br></br> <br></br>
            Increases program speed and quality: Increases performance by providing high-performance implementations of useful data structures and algorithms because in this case, the programmer need not think of the best implementation of a specific data structure. He can simply use the best implementation to drastically boost the performance of his algorithm/program.
