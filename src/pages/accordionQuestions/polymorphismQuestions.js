      title: 'What is Polymorphism in Java OOP?',
      info: `Polymorphism in java is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming system. Polymorphism means “many forms” in Greek. That is one thing that can take many forms.

      Polymorphism is a concept by which we can perform a single task in different ways. That is, when a single entity (object) behaves differently in different cases, it is called polymorphism.
      
      In other words, if a single object shows multiple forms or multiple behaviors, it is called polymorphism.`

      title: 'What are the advantages of Polymorphism?',
      info: `There are the following advantages of polymorphism in java:

      a. Using polymorphism, we can achieve flexibility in our code because we can perform various operations by using methods with the same names according to requirements.
      
      b. The main benefit of using polymorphism is when we can provide implementation to an abstract base class or an interface.`
