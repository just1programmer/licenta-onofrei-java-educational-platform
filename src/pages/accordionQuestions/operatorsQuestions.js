      title: 'What is Expression in Java?',
      info:
        `An expression in java is a combination of operators and operands that is used to perform mathematical or logical calculations. In simple words, it is a combination of variables, constants, and operators.

        For example, an expression is x+5. Here, the operand x is a variable, operand 5 is a constant, and + is an operator that acts on these two operands and produces the desired result.`,

      title: 'What are Logical operators in Java?',
      info : `Logical operators in Java are those operators that are used to form compound conditions by combining two or more conditions or relational expressions.

      These operators are also called Boolean operators because they return a boolean value.`
